fan blow up over this , Ali then posted that wanna hear my project fans wanted it so he did a video , video [ No the Video 30 mint long
How I developed a game LRCH level without using the LRCH engine
Video yo fam what up uhm my like at DARC is ambition I got promoted 7 months ago ( got it happen 7 months ago but he shared the story now)

Last 7 months I planned a game after hear about Animatik long before I leaked it from my manager I  applied a a tester so they gave me the software I decided uhm I wanna make I game but I didn't know where to start so I played lrch for hours observing some few things
Then I came up with a game Eden call : clash of realms

I don't have access to the engine that built LRCH and mlw so I entered Animatik and carried a 2d picture I stated with a creature of my making it using the 2d-3d converter I converted it to 3d it was quite stunning almost like a life actor I stayed 8 hr editing it to make it real I said if I wanna do a LRCH game uhm u gata do more than that I closed my PC for like 2 week the I said let me make terrain is stored with my terrain I used Animatik , microOB to do trains some 5km2 large I spent 2 months doing that then I went to Musa I showed him my stuff he said u wan kill it self I just laughed I did my plan I need 400 did characters from anime , monster stores like vampire , etc super detailed like this one the one I design I beg him to help me up my BILIlang so Ihe showed me some few stuff then I said hmm I dedicate the next two months with animation I heard some months ago during the production of MlW that their this took called clockRAR it was deved by 12 DARC tech college teens at port harcout it refers 3Billion nodes of details, sub animation,under one segment like a. Stone aseg all the particle everything in time frame like min sec animation I said bro I'll need more bros so I told my twin can u help he as busy so I went to one of my team mates I said SKWILL also minute hard ware interolorations  I said I want  tonuse clockRAR+ Skwil to do my animation for my character he explained that clackrar is in Abuja and I need to go there a borrow access
Bro I spent 2 WKs planning my speech when I get to Abuja ü§£ü§£ then I went there I asked , begged I payed uhm 2 million for this [ I'm not forgiving u guy at Abuja pust a evil sticker to the screen] I got the flash connected to to my arc OC and clockRAR laged on my ar dext which by the way ahs c2 prossesor so I upgraded to the uhm dext 5 which had arc ring c3 now we are talking clockrar loade so I use BILIlang and little darvi to set up RUles for the click the time each node etc I spent 3wks on this then all my rules were set up the next set is my physc biology rules that is heart beat all the  skin hair I use TIME STOP 0 LITE FOR this to get that slow Mo stuff + clockRAR when my time rules were completely bio rules were complete mind u all on BILIlang I had help from Musa and my twin at one point me and Musa had a disagreement but nothing wey suya no fit solve  them now my 400 character no escaping Darvi or olumba or any of the 7 big language at this point I sent to Abuja to return the clockRAR access and also to disturb the rabbi nerd there with their help I created a way for rabbi to created new voice pattern for my character and also a way to pas my character discrepti and rabbit to use microOB form the characters I also got the new voice patterns I returned to Lagos with 300gb worth of assets I stated apsing in my rules I've deved with clockRAR for time animation and TIME STOP for extra realism by the end of 4 months I have my character my terrains with physics everything then I started my code on my INSTRco ( darcs text editor ) coding scriots on BILIlang , SKWILL,( thank to my bro ) navita , I worked 19hrs a day my frevday on this
I also used Animatik voice gen feature to do voice gen for my anime side I don't need new voice patterns so that was easy
So i did the whole game , after 5 months I'm done  and I'm proud ü•≤ of my self I ALSO reduced weight though
Musa was really proud of me
Then I added Namini emulator stuff and all them I want this game to have all these and also run on low end devices like Samsung s25 ultra so I went to port harcout to get help from the DFD ( DARC FILE DIFRACTOR) I spent hours in classes so since I've been codinga way now the game file is 50gb when in zip then when decompress it 96gb I've been looking but I'm this ü§èüèª close to finally doing it
[ Shows the game play
On Naminee emulator on Gloral 1 it works very fine on Gloral he matched up Naruto vs a vampire
Naruto there in bae then the turn him to sage of 6 paths chakra mod ( the fire the glow the realism the truth seeking orb ) then he held the key and does the rasegan ( the he say up let me use the whole chakra bar of a rasagann he used up the whole chakra fo rasagan Naruto then called the gigantic ball planet ransegen and notice the chara the spinning the motion everything ] I think is smoth but I'm still trying maybe by next month I will finally be able to run it on Samsung without the device blowing up but what do yal think

MLW ( AVAILABLE ON NAMINEE EMULATOR AND NAMINNE GL EMULATOR)


üéÆ MLW ‚Äì My Life‚Äôs Worth

üìú Core Premise

Set in the 1600s, during the early colonial/Atlantic trade era.

You play as a young Asian girl  ( Alyssa)who is betrayed and sold off to an American household.

The entire story follows her struggle for identity, survival, and freedom in a world that treats her as property.



---

üåÄ Themes

Slavery & Humanity ‚Äì showing how different cultures treated ‚Äúthe other.‚Äù

Worth of Life ‚Äì the meaning of dignity when the system sees you as worthless.

Cross-Cultural Tension ‚Äì Asia, Africa, Europe, America colliding in early trade/colonial period.



---

üåç Gameplay Structure

Narrative-driven: choices branch storylines (like Telltale Games, but with DARC‚Äôs heavy realism).

Medieval settings: sailing ships, colonial towns, plantations, early trade hubs.

Character Progression:

Learn languages to survive (Mandarin ‚Üí English ‚Üí maybe Portuguese/Spanish).

Build alliances with enslaved Africans, poor Europeans, Indigenous people.

Decide: submit, resist, escape, or manipulate.




---

üé• Cinematic Tone

Dark, raw, emotional ‚Äî not flashy fantasy.

Imagine The Last of Us storytelling but set in 1600s America with slavery + survival.

The girl‚Äôs flashbacks to her home in Asia act as ‚Äúmemory chapters‚Äù that contrast innocence vs. her current suffering.



---

‚ö° Why It Stands Out

No one has told this kind of story in AAA gaming: an Asian enslaved girl in the 1600s navigating survival in the early colonial world.

Fits DARC‚Äôs style ‚Üí raw realism, cultural authenticity, and heavy moral weight.
Ahhh okay I see how you‚Äôre structuring it now üòéüî•

So MLW (My Life‚Äôs Work) works like this:

The base game file = 250GB (this is the world engine, assets, and main systems).

Then every season (S1, S2, etc.) drops in episodes (Ep1, Ep2 ‚Ä¶) as smaller downloads (like DLC packs).


For example:

üìÇ Game Structure

MLW Base (250GB) ‚Üí installs the entire medieval/colonial world engine, physics, AI, voice, textures.

S2 Ep1 (5GB) ‚Üí just unlocks/playable content for that episode (3hrs story).

5GB because it reuses most of the 250GB base files (world, NPCs, locations).




---

üéÆ S2 Ep1 (3hrs Play)

Focus: the girl‚Äôs arrival in America.

Cinematic intro ‚Üí chained voyage across the ocean, storms, disease, whispers of rebellion below deck.

First 30 mins ‚Üí ship gameplay (talk with other captives, make early choices).

Middle ‚Üí arrival at port, auction scene (gut-wrenching, heavily cinematic).

Final hour ‚Üí introduction to her new ‚Äúmaster‚Äôs house‚Äù + first interactive rebellion seed (steal, sneak, test her courage).

Ends on cliffhanger: her first night, deciding whether to submit, escape, or fight.
